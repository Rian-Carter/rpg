Goals:
Make a character
  <!-- Characters have stats --> 
  Chracters have abilities
  Characters can have items // do last
    Items can give stat bonuses / have stats themselves (Eg damage)
  <!-- Characters have Names -->
  <!-- Characters have Classes -->

Fight things
  Roll dice to figure out what enemy you fight
    Same enemy but stats are different depending on character you choose
  Roll dice to figure out combat resolution > Repeat until Player or enemy is at 0 hit points
    Each participant generates a random number, whoever has the higher number does the difference of the two numbers in damage to the character with the lower number > Items and Stats can effect this
